language: Java
architecture_evolution: "Procedural (Stages 1-4) -> Polymorphic Enum (Stages 5-8)"

history:
  - stage: 1
    title: "Buzz Numbers"
    commit_header: "feat: parity check and buzz number logic"
    description: "Initial setup for natural number input. Implemented modular arithmetic to identify Even, Odd, and Buzz numbers (divisible by 7 or ending in 7)."

  - stage: 2
    title: "Duck Numbers"
    commit_header: "feat: add duck number logic and input validation"
    description: "Implemented digit-based search for '0' and added robust error handling for non-natural number inputs."

  - stage: 3
    title: "Palindromic Numbers"
    commit_header: "feat: palindromic numbers and property mapping"
    description: "Added string-reversal logic. Transitioned to a Map<String, Boolean> structure to store number properties dynamically."

  - stage: 4
    title: "Gapful Numbers"
    commit_header: "feat: gapful numbers and range requests"
    description: "Introduced logic for numbers divisible by the concatenation of their first and last digits. Updated UI to support consecutive range requests."

  - stage: 5
    title: "Spy Numbers"
    commit_header: "refactor: migrate to polymorphic Enum architecture"
    description: "MAJOR REFACTOR: Replaced procedural methods with an abstract Enum-based testing engine to handle Spy number logic and improve scalability."

  - stage: 6
    title: "Sunny and Square Numbers"
    commit_header: "feat: add sunny and square numbers to Enum engine"
    description: "Leveraged the new Enum architecture to easily integrate Square and Sunny (n+1 is square) property checks."

  - stage: 7
    title: "Jumping Numbers"
    commit_header: "feat: implement jumping numbers and multi-property search"
    description: "Implemented digit-adjacency logic (diff of 1). Expanded request handling to allow searching for multiple properties simultaneously."

  - stage: 8
    title: "Happy and Sad Numbers"
    commit_header: "feat: finalize happy numbers and negative filters"
    description: "Implemented recursive square-sum logic for Happy numbers. Completed the engine with support for exclusionary '-property' filtering and logical contradiction detection."
